# apkill
Script for Aircrack-ng that makes deauthing clients from WiFi simple and fast.

The script is optimized for debianesque systems. If you are on a system with Aptitude installed, dependecies will be automatically installed during first run. (For more information about dependencies view the first lines of the script.) 

INSTALLATION: 

Just mark the script as executable and run it. 
chmod +x apkill.sh && ./apkill.sh

Non Debian: 
Check source and edit the few bits that need to be changed. All systems that are somewhat similiar Distros to Debian work as well.
